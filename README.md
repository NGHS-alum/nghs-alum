This project was made in memory of Mr. Lambert and aims to provide resourcing and mentoring to students in his absence.

# Goals
1. Encourage people to have high expectations. Whether this means to aim for getting into prestigious schools, getting large scholarships or landing high paying internship/jobs, don't want people to have low standards.
2. Provide a collection of internships/jobs. No one wants to hire people without experience so getting that first job in your desired field can be more difficult than it should. So this site has a collection of [internships](https://nghs-alum.github.io/Internships.html) geared to graduating high school seniors and even some for [juniors](https://nghs-alum.github.io/HS_Internships.html)
3. Provide general advice. Maybe you want to know how to become ready for some of the jobs listed above or just want an intro some area not covered in your regular classes. The Internet is a great place, but we may also be able to help point you in the right direction.

# What do I do
Maybe you want to know some [internship](https://nghs-alum.github.io/Internships.html) or what some experience to boost your [resume](https://nghs-alum.github.io/HS_Internships.html) for college. Maybe you are looking for a [full time job](https://nghs-alum.github.io/Jobs.html). Perhaps you want to [network or want some advice](https://nghs-alum.github.io/contact.html)

# Who is this meant for
Well first there are no requirements to view/benefit from this page and want to encourage anybody who is interested to take full advantage.

* 2nd semester HS juniors and 1st semester seniors are most likely to fine this project the most helpful. (For 2nd semester seniors, a good portion of application windows will have passed).
* For college students, this may still prove useful, but you'll have access to large career fairs with (hopefully) more opportunities than those listed here.
* For high school underclassmen, no one wants you. Only half joking; there may exist some place that will take you. I don't know of any. May want to focus on building up that resume and there are certainly things you can do to make yourselves more competitive.
* And to at least try to keep alumni motivated to stay involved there is a full job listing too.

So there is intent for this to be useful to everyone, but to what extent will vary depending on who decides to participate.
