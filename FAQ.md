# FAQ

## What kind of mentoring is available
Depends. At the very least, answers to quick questions and all the pointers to references you'd want. Anything more would probably vary with the person and what people want and how many alum are interested.

## I'm planning on majoring in field X and non of the alum majored in anything similar
If you're OK with possible second hand advice, feel free to still reach out.

## Can I add a job/internship even if I'm not alum
Sure. Why not. Just open a PR.

## What is a PR
PR - [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is how you contribute to this effort. Once you have an account on Github, you can click the fork button on the top-right, make whatever changes you want locally and then submit a pull request. Once submitted, that gives us maintainers the ability to review it and once approved it gets added the main site.

## One of the external links is broken? Can you fix it
Feel free to correct it if it is trivial. If link is completely dead, then remove it. If you aren't sure, consider reaching out to the original poster (see git blame) and see if they can update it.

## I have some idea. Can it be added
Open an [Issue](https://github.com/NGHS-alum/nghs-alum/issues) explaining your idea and the merits behind it and we can talk. Or if it is simple just implement it and open a PR.
